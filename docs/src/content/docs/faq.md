## Creating Stacked PRs

### What is a Stacked PR? How is it different from a regular PR?

A Stacked PR is a pull request that is part of an ordered chain of PRs, where each PR targets the branch of the PR below it instead of targeting `main` directly. Each PR in the stack represents one focused layer of a larger change. Individually, each PR is still a regular pull request — it just has a different base branch, and GitHub understands the relationship between the PRs in the stack.

### How do I create a Stacked PR?

You can create a stack using the `gh stack` CLI:

```sh
gh stack init auth-layer
# ... make commits on the first branch ...
gh stack add api-routes
# ... make commits ...
gh stack add request-validation
# ... make commits ...
gh stack submit
```

You can also create stacks entirely from the GitHub UI — create the first PR normally, then when creating subsequent PRs, select the option to add them to a stack. See [Creating a Stack from the UI](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#creating-a-stack-from-the-ui) for a walkthrough.

### How do I add PRs to my stack?

Use `gh stack add <branch-name>` to add a new branch on top of the current stack. When you run `gh stack submit`, a PR is created for each branch, and they are linked together as a Stack on GitHub.

You can also add PRs to an existing stack from the GitHub UI. See [Adding to an Existing Stack](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#adding-to-an-existing-stack) for details.

### How can I modify my stack?

Use `gh stack modify` to restructure a stack. It opens an interactive terminal UI where you can reorder, drop, fold (combine), insert, and rename branches — then applies all changes at once. See the [Restructuring Stacks](/gh-stack/guides/modify/) guide for a full walkthrough.

Alternatively, you can manually tear down and re-create the stack with `gh stack unstack` and `gh stack init`:

```sh
# 1. Remove the stack
gh stack unstack

# 2. Make structural changes (reorder, rename, insert, delete branches)
git branch -m api-roots api-routes

# 3. Re-create the stack with the new structure
gh stack init db-migrations api-routes frontend
```

### How do I delete my stack?

**From the CLI** — Run `gh stack unstack` (or `gh stack delete`) to delete the stack on GitHub and remove local tracking. Use `--local` to only remove local tracking.

**From the UI** — You can unstack PRs from the GitHub UI — see [Unstacking](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#unstacking) for a walkthrough. This dissolves the association between PRs, turning them back into standard independent PRs.

### Can stacks be created across forks?

No, Stacked PRs currently require all branches to be in the same repository. Cross-fork stacks are not supported.

## Checks, Rules & Requirements

### How are branch protection rules evaluated for Stacked PRs?

Every PR in a stack is treated as if it is targeting the **base of the stack** (typically `main`), regardless of which branch it directly targets. This means:

- **Required reviews** are evaluated as if the PR is targeting the stack base.
- **Required status checks** are evaluated as if the PR is targeting the stack base.
- **CODEOWNERS** are evaluated from the stack base — changes in `CODEOWNERS` on a PR at the bottom of the stack will not affect PRs above it in the stack.
- **Code scanning workflows** are evaluated as if the PR is targeting the stack base.

### How do GitHub Actions work with Stacked PRs?

GitHub Actions workflows trigger as if each PR in the stack is targeting the base of the stack (e.g., `main`). If you have a workflow configured to run on `pull_request` events targeting `main`, it will run for **every PR in the stack** — not just the bottom one.

### How do I access stack metadata in my GitHub Actions workflow?

For advanced use cases, you can access the stack's base ref and base SHA in workflow expressions via `github.event.pull_request.stack`. This property is only present when the PR belongs to a stack.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Show stack info
        if: github.event.pull_request.stack != null
        run: |
          echo "Stack base ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.stack.base.ref }}"
          echo "Stack base SHA: ${{ github.event.pull_request.stack.base.sha }}"

      - name: Run a step only when the stack targets a release branch
        if: github.event.pull_request.stack != null && startsWith(github.event.pull_request.stack.base.ref, 'release/')
        run: echo "This stack targets a release branch"
```

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `github.event.pull_request.stack.base.ref` | The branch the entire stack ultimately targets (e.g., `main`). |
| `github.event.pull_request.stack.base.sha` | The HEAD SHA of that target branch at the time of the event. |

See the [Webhooks reference](/gh-stack/reference/webhooks/) for the full details on the `stack` object in webhook payloads.

### Do all previous PRs need to be passing checks before I can merge?

Yes. In order to merge a PR in the stack, **all PRs below it** must also have passing checks and meet all merge requirements. For example, in a stack of `main <- PR1 <- PR2 <- PR3`, if you want to merge PR #3, both PR #1 and PR #2 must have passing checks, required reviews, and satisfy all branch protection rules.

### Is a linear history required?

Yes. There must be a **fully linear history** between each of the branches in the stack. This is a strict requirement for merging.

If the stack is not linear (e.g., after changes were pushed to a lower branch), you can fix it in two ways:

- **From the CLI** — Run `gh stack rebase` to perform a cascading rebase locally and then push with `gh stack push`.
- **From the UI** — Click the **Rebase Stack** button in the merge box to trigger a server-side cascading rebase. This rebases the entire stack on top of the latest trunk, updates every unmerged branch on top of its base branch, and force-pushes the results. See [Rebasing from the UI](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#rebasing-from-the-ui) for details.

## Merging Stacked PRs

### What conditions need to be met for a Stacked PR to be mergeable?

Every PR in a stack must meet the same merge requirements as a PR targeting the stack base (e.g., `main`): required reviews, passing CI checks, CODEOWNER approvals, and a linear history. All PRs below it must also meet these requirements. See the [Checks, Rules & Requirements](#checks-rules--requirements) section above for details.

### How does merging a stack of PRs differ from merging a regular PR?

Stacks merge from the bottom up as a single atomic operation. When you click merge on a PR in a stack, that PR and all unmerged PRs below it land on the base branch together. PRs above remain open, and the remaining stack is automatically rebased so the next PR targets `main` directly.

### What happens when you merge a PR in the middle of the stack?

When you click merge on a PR in the middle of the stack, that PR and all unmerged PRs below it land on the base branch together as a single atomic operation, ordered from the bottom up in the resulting history. PRs above the selected one remain open. After the merge, the lowest unmerged PR is updated to target the stack base directly, and a cascading rebase runs across the remaining branches.

It is not possible to merge a middle PR in isolation: the PRs below it always merge with it.

### How does squash merge work?

Squash merges are fully supported. Each PR in the stack produces one clean, squashed commit when merged. Merging `n` PRs will create `n` squashed commits on the base.

When a PR is squash-merged, the original commits disappear from the history, which can cause artificial merge conflicts during rebasing. Both the CLI and the server handle this using `git rebase --onto`:

```
git rebase --onto <new_commit_sha_generated_by_squash> <original_commit_sha_from_tip_of_merged_branch> <branch_name>
```

**Example:** Consider a stack with three PRs:

```
PR1: main ← A, B              (branch1)
PR2: main ← A, B, C, D        (branch2)
PR3: main ← A, B, C, D, E, F  (branch3)
```

When PR1 and PR2 are squash-merged, `main` now looks like:

```
S1 (squash of A+B), S2 (squash of C+D)
```

Then the following rebase is run:

```
git rebase --onto S2 D branch3
```

Which rewrites `branch3` to:

```
S1, S2, E, F
```

This moves the unique commits from the unmerged branch and replays them on top of the newly squashed commits on the base branch, avoiding any merge conflicts.

### How does merge commit work?

When you merge a stack using the merge commit strategy, it creates **one merge commit for the entire group** of PRs being merged. The full commit history of each PR is preserved within the merge commit.

### How does rebase merge work?

With rebase merge, the commits from each PR in the stack are replayed onto the base branch, creating a linear history without merge commits. The full set of commits lands as a single atomic operation.

### Do all PRs get merged at once or one at a time?

All PRs in the stack land in a single atomic operation. When you click merge on a PR, that PR and all unmerged PRs below it are merged together onto the base branch at the same time, ordered from the bottom up in the resulting history. PRs above the selected one remain open.

This applies whether or not a merge queue is enabled. With a merge queue, the same atomic landing happens once the stack's merge group reaches the front of the queue.

### Can I merge only part of a stack? What happens to the remaining unmerged PRs?

Yes, partial stack merges are supported. After the merge, the lowest unmerged PR is updated to explicitly target the stack base (e.g., `main`). A cascading rebase is also automatically run to rebase the remaining unmerged branches.

### What happens if you close a PR in the middle of the stack?

Closing a PR in the middle of the stack will block all PRs above it from being mergeable. The stack relationship is preserved, so if you want to open a different PR or modify the stack, you will need to unstack and then re-create the stack.

### What happens when there is an error merging a PR in the middle of a stack?

Pre-merge checks run before any merge attempt, but a merge can still fail (e.g., due to an unexpected merge conflict or intermittent failure). If a failure occurs partway through, merging stops at that PR. PRs below it that successfully merged remain landed on the base branch; the failed PR and PRs above it stay open. Resolve the issue on the failed PR and retry to land the rest of the stack.

### Do Stacked PRs support merge queue?

Yes, Stacked PRs fully support merging via merge queue. When you merge a stack through the merge queue:

- **All PRs in the stack are added to the queue** in the correct order, ensuring a linear sequence.
- **If a PR is removed or ejected from the merge queue**, all PRs above it in the stack are also ejected and removed from the queue.
- **Stacks are kept in the same merge group on a best-effort basis.** To keep a stack together, the merge queue allows the merge group to exceed its configured max size by up to 50%. If the stack is too large to fit within that buffer, it splits across consecutive merge groups: as much of the stack as fits goes into the current group, and the remaining PRs continue in subsequent groups until the full stack has landed.

## Local Development

### Do you have a CLI to help manage stacks?

Yes! The `gh stack` CLI extension handles creating stacks, adding branches, rebasing, pushing, navigating, and syncing. Install it with:

```sh
gh extension install github/gh-stack
```

See the [CLI Reference](/gh-stack/reference/cli/) for the full command documentation.

### Do I need to use the GitHub CLI?

No. Stacked PRs are built on standard git branches and regular pull requests. You can create and manage them manually with `git` and the GitHub UI. The CLI just makes the workflow much simpler — especially for rebasing, pushing, and creating PRs with the correct base branches.

### Will this work with a different tool for stacking?

Yes, you can continue to use your tool of choice (e.g., jj, Sapling, git-town, etc.) to manage stacks locally and push up your branches to GitHub.

Stacked PRs on GitHub are based on the standard pull request model — any tool that creates PRs with the correct base branches can work with them. The `gh stack` CLI is purpose-built for the GitHub experience, but other tools that manage branch chains should be compatible.

You can also use the `gh stack link` command in conjunction with other tools to open your PRs as a stack:


```bash
# Create a stack of branches locally using jj
jj new main -m "first change"
jj bookmark create change1 --revision @
# ...

jj new -m "second change"
jj bookmark create change2 --revision @
# ...

jj new -m "third change"
jj bookmark create change3 --revision @
# ...

# Push branches and link them as a stack on GitHub
# (creates PRs automatically if they don't exist)
gh stack link change1 change2 change3
```

This doesn't create any local tracking and only hits the APIs to create Stacked PRs.

If the provided branches already have open PRs, `link` will use them. If not, it creates draft PRs by default with the correct base branch chaining.

To add more to the stack, run `link` again, but be sure to include the full list of PRs/branches in the stack:

```bash
gh stack link 123 124 125 change4 change5
```

You can also use `--base` to specify a different trunk branch and `--open` to mark PRs as ready for review:

```bash
gh stack link --base develop --open change1 change2 change3
```

Alternatively, if you want full local stack tracking (for commands like `rebase`, `sync`, and navigation), you can adopt existing branches to local tracking with `gh stack init`:

```bash
gh stack init change1 change2 change3
gh stack submit
```
