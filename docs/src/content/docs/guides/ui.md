title: Stacked PRs in the GitHub UI
description: A visual walkthrough of creating, navigating, merging, and managing Stacked PRs directly in the GitHub pull request UI.

This guide walks through the key UI components and workflows for working with Stacked PRs on GitHub.

## Navigating Stacked PRs

When a pull request is part of a stack, a **stack navigator** appears in the PR header. This component gives you an at-a-glance view of the entire stack and lets you jump between PRs.

The stack navigator shows:

- All PRs in the stack, listed in order from top to bottom
- Which PR you're currently viewing (highlighted)
- Clickable links to navigate directly to any PR in the stack
- Link to Add to Stack, where you can create a new PR that targets the head of the topmost PR
- Unstack option to dissolve the association between PRs, turning them back into standard PRs

## Creating a Stack from the UI

You can create Stacked PRs entirely from the GitHub UI.

### Step 1: Create the first PR normally

Create a pull request as you normally would. The first PR in the stack targets `main` (or whatever you want as your trunk branch). There's nothing special about this step.

### Step 2: Create subsequent PRs and add them to the stack

When you create the next PR, set its base branch to the first PR's branch. You'll see a checkbox or option to **Create stack**. Select this to link this PR to the previous one, starting a new stack.

### Step 3: Confirm the stack

After creating the PR, you'll see the stack navigator appear in the header, showing both PRs linked together.

Repeat this process for each additional PR in the stack — each one targets the branch of the PR before it.

## Adding to an Existing Stack

If a stack already exists and you want to add a new PR to it:

1. Open a PR in the stack, click the stack icon in the header, and click **Add**.

2. On the following page, the base branch is automatically set to the head of the topmost PR. Select the head branch for your new PR and click **Create pull request**.

3. Select the checkbox for **Add to existing stack** and create your pull request.

The new PR will be added to the top of the stack, which you will see on the PRs page.

## The Merge Box

The merge box for a Stacked PR works differently from a regular PR. It shows not just the current PR's merge status, but the status of the entire stack.

### Merge Requirements

Before a PR in the stack can be merged, the following conditions must be met:

- **All PRs below it** must be approved and have passing checks
- **The stack must be fully rebased** with a linear history
- **The current PR itself** must meet all branch protection requirements for the stack base

### Rebasing from the UI

When the stack is not linear (e.g., after changes were pushed to a lower branch, or after `main` has moved ahead), a **Rebase Stack** button appears in the merge box. Clicking it triggers a server-side cascading rebase that:

1. Rebases the entire stack on top of the latest trunk (e.g., `main`) HEAD.
2. Rebases every unmerged branch on top of the latest changes from its base branch, working from the bottom of the stack upward.
3. Force-pushes each rebased branch to update the remote.

After the rebase completes, all PRs in the stack reflect the updated branches and CI checks are re-triggered.

:::note[Commit signing]
Commits created by a server-side rebase are **not signed**. If your repository requires signed commits, we recommend using the CLI. Running `gh stack rebase` uses local git operations, so the generated commits will follow your local git signing configuration. After rebasing locally, you can force push your updated branches with `gh stack push`.

## Unstacking

If you want to reorder or reorganize the PRs in a stack from the UI, you must first dissolve the stack and then re-create it. For CLI users, `gh stack modify` provides an interactive way to [restructure a stack](/gh-stack/guides/modify/) — including reordering, inserting, dropping, and renaming branches — without needing to dissolve it.

### Dissolving the Entire Stack

To dissolve the stack entirely (turning all Stacked PRs back into independent PRs), use the unstack option on the stack itself.

After unstacking, each PR retains its current base branch but is no longer linked to the other PRs. The stack navigator and stack-related merge requirements disappear from all affected PRs.
