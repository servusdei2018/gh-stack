## Why Stacks?

For developers who want to break large changes into smaller, dependent parts, the experience can be painful:

- **Branch management** — Rebasing and keeping branches in sync across dependent PRs is tedious and error-prone.
- **Rules and CI** — Branch protection rules and CI checks often only trigger for the bottom PR in the chain, making it hard to know the true status of the rest.
- **Review context** — Reviewing a single change out of context from the rest of the stack can impact review quality.

## What Is a Stack?

A **pull request stack** consists of two or more pull requests in the same repository where:

- The **first (bottom) pull request** targets the main branch (e.g., `main`).
- Each subsequent pull request targets the branch of the PR below it.

```
   ┌── feat/frontend     → PR #3 (base: feat/api-endpoints)  ← top
  ┌── feat/api-endpoints → PR #2 (base: feat/auth-layer)
 ┌── feat/auth-layer     → PR #1 (base: main)               ← bottom
main (trunk)
```

Each pull request in a stack:

- Represents an atomic, reviewable change (one or more commits).
- Can be reviewed and iterated on independently.
- Is evaluated for rules and protections using its **final target branch** (e.g., `main`), not the branch it directly targets.
- Can be merged directly or via merge queue, as long as the PRs below it are merged first (or at the same time).

## GitHub Stacked PRs

GitHub supports Stacked PRs natively, combining a rich pull request UI with the `gh stack` CLI to give both authors and reviewers a seamless experience.

### Stack Map in the PR UI

When a pull request is part of a stack, a **stack map** appears at the top of the PR page. It shows every PR in the stack, their status, and lets you navigate to any layer with one click. This gives reviewers immediate context about where a PR fits in the bigger picture.

### Rules and CI Enforcement

The merge requirements for any PR in the stack are determined by the **bottom PR's base** — typically `main`. This means:

- **Branch protection rules** like CODEOWNER approvals are enforced on every PR in the stack, even mid-stack PRs that don't directly target `main`.
- **CI checks** triggered by pull requests on `main` run for all PRs in the stack, not just the bottom one.

This ensures that every layer of the stack meets the same quality bar before it can be merged.

### Merging Stacks

The entire stack does not need to be merged at once, but PRs must be merged **from the bottom up**. GitHub supports two merge methods:

- **Direct merge** — Merges a PR (and all non-merged PRs below it) in a single operation, as long as all conditions are met.
- **Merge queue** — Works as usual but is stack-aware. For example, if the bottom PR is removed from the queue, all other PRs in the stack are also removed.

The resulting commit history is the same as merging each PR individually, starting from the bottom.

### Merge Methods

Stacks support all three merge methods:

- **Merge commit** — Creates one merge commit for the entire group of changes being merged. The full commit history of each PR is preserved.
- **Squash merge** — Creates one clean, squashed commit per PR. Each PR's commits are combined into a single commit on the target branch.
- **Rebase merge** — Replays all commits from each PR onto the base branch, creating a linear history without merge commits.

### Simplified Rebasing

Rebasing is the trickiest part of working with Stacked PRs, and GitHub handles it automatically:

- **In the PR UI** — A **Rebase Stack** button lets you trigger a server-side cascading rebase. It rebases the entire stack on top of the latest trunk, updates every unmerged branch, and force-pushes the results. See [Rebasing from the UI](/gh-stack/guides/ui/#rebasing-from-the-ui) for details.
- **From the CLI** — `gh stack rebase` performs the same cascading rebase locally.
- **After partial merges** — When you merge a PR at the bottom of the stack, the remaining branches are automatically rebased so the next PR targets `main` and is ready for review and merge.
- **Safe squash-merge handling** — Squash merges are fully supported. The rebase engine safely replays your unique commits on top of the squashed base, avoiding artificial merge conflicts. See the [FAQ](/gh-stack/faq/#how-does-squash-merge-work) for a detailed description of how this works.

## The CLI: `gh stack`

While the PR UI provides the review and merge experience, the `gh stack` CLI handles the local development workflow:

- **Creating branches** — `gh stack init` and `gh stack add` create and track branches in the correct dependency order.
- **Keeping branches rebased** — `gh stack rebase` cascades changes through the stack, handling both regular and squash-merged PRs.
- **Pushing branches** — `gh stack push` pushes all branches to the remote.
- **Creating PRs** — `gh stack submit` pushes branches and creates or updates PRs, linking them as a Stack on GitHub.
- **Navigating the stack** — `gh stack up`, `down`, `top`, and `bottom` let you move between layers without remembering branch names.
- **Syncing everything** — `gh stack sync` fetches, rebases, pushes, and updates PR state in one command.
- **Restructuring stacks** — `gh stack modify` opens an interactive terminal UI to drop, fold, insert, rename, and reorder branches in a stack.
- **Tearing down stacks** — `gh stack unstack` removes a stack from GitHub and local tracking.
- **Checking out a stack** — `gh stack checkout <pr-number>` pulls down a stack, with all its branches, from GitHub to your local machine.

The CLI is not required to use Stacked PRs — the underlying git operations are standard. But it makes the workflow simpler, and you can create Stacked PRs from the CLI instead of the UI.

**Bring Your Own Tools:** You don't need to use the `gh stack` CLI for your local workflow. If you use tools like Jujutsu, Sapling, or custom tools to manage and push your local branches, you can then use the CLI or the GitHub UI to open a stack of PRs from those branches. See the [FAQ](/gh-stack/faq/#will-this-work-with-a-different-tool-for-stacking) for examples.

## Thinking About Stack Structure

Each branch in a stack should represent a **discrete, logical unit of work** that can be reviewed independently. Think of a stack from the reviewer's perspective: the PRs should tell a cohesive story, where each one is a small, logical piece of the whole.

### Dependency Chain

Stacked branches form a dependency chain: each branch builds on the one below it. This means foundational changes (models, shared types, database schema) go in lower branches, and code that depends on them (API routes, UI components) goes in higher branches.

```
   ┌── feat/frontend-ui  ← UI components that call the APIs
  ┌── feat/api-endpoints ← API routes that use the models
 ┌── feat/data-models    ← shared types, database schema
main (trunk)
```

The key principle: if code in one layer depends on code in another, the dependency must be in the same branch or a lower one.

### When to Create a New Branch

Create a new branch when you're starting a different concern that depends on what you've built so far:

- You're switching from backend to frontend work
- You're moving from core logic to tests or documentation
- The next set of changes has a different reviewer audience
- The current branch's PR is already large enough to review
