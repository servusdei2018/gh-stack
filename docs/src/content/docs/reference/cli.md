## Stack Management

### `gh stack init`

Initialize a new stack in the current repository.

```sh
gh stack init [flags] [branches...]
```

Initializes a new stack locally. In interactive mode (no arguments), prompts for a branch name and offers to use the current branch as the first layer. If a branch name contains slashes (e.g., `feat/api`), prompts if you would like to use a prefix (e.g., `feat/`) for all branches in the stack.

When explicit branch names are given, existing branches are adopted automatically and any missing branches are created. The trunk defaults to the repository's default branch unless overridden with `--base`.

Use `--numbered` with `--prefix` to enable auto-incrementing branch names (`prefix/01`, `prefix/02`, …).

Enables `git rerere` automatically so that conflict resolutions are remembered across rebases.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-b, --base <branch>` | Trunk branch for the stack (defaults to the repository's default branch) |
| `-p, --prefix <string>` | Set a branch name prefix for the stack |
| `-n, --numbered` | Use auto-incrementing numbered branch names (requires `--prefix`) |

**Examples:**

```sh
# Interactive — prompts for branch names
gh stack init

# Non-interactive — specify first branch upfront
gh stack init feature-auth

# Use a different trunk branch
gh stack init --base develop feature-auth

# Adopt or create multiple branches at once
gh stack init feature-auth feature-api feature-ui

# Set a prefix — prompts for a branch name suffix
gh stack init -p feat
#    → type "auth" → creates feat/auth

# Use numbered auto-incrementing branch names
gh stack init -p feat --numbered
#    → creates feat/01 automatically
```

### `gh stack add`

Add a new branch on top of the current stack.

```sh
gh stack add [flags] [branch]
```

Creates a new branch at the current HEAD, adds it to the top of the stack, and checks it out. Must be run while on the topmost branch of a stack. If no branch name is given, prompts for one.

You can optionally stage changes and create a commit as part of the `add` flow. When `-m` is provided without an explicit branch name, the branch name is auto-generated. If the stack was created with `--numbered`, auto-generated names use numbered format (`prefix/01`, `prefix/02`); otherwise, date+slug format is used.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-A, --all` | Stage all changes (including untracked files); requires `-m` |
| `-u, --update` | Stage changes to tracked files only; requires `-m` |
| `-m, --message <string>` | Create a commit with this message before creating the branch |

> **Note:** `-A` and `-u` are mutually exclusive.

**Examples:**

```sh
# Create a branch by name
gh stack add api-routes

# Prompt for a branch name interactively
gh stack add

# Stage all changes, commit, and auto-generate the branch name
gh stack add -Am "Add login endpoint"

# Stage only tracked files, commit, and auto-generate the branch name
gh stack add -um "Fix auth bug"

# Commit already-staged changes and auto-generate the branch name
gh stack add -m "Add user model"

# Stage all changes, commit, and use an explicit branch name
gh stack add -Am "Add tests" test-layer

# Stage only tracked files, commit, and use an explicit branch name
gh stack add -um "Update docs" docs-layer
```

### `gh stack view`

View the current stack.

```sh
gh stack view [flags]
```

Shows all branches in the stack, their ordering, PR links, and the most recent commit with a relative timestamp. Output is piped through a pager (respects `GIT_PAGER`, `PAGER`, or defaults to `less -R`).

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s, --short` | Compact output (branch names only) |
| `--json` | Output stack data as JSON |

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack view
gh stack view --short
gh stack view --json
```

### `gh stack checkout`

Check out a stack from a pull request number, URL, or branch name.

```sh
gh stack checkout [<pr-number> | <pr-url> | <branch>]
```

When a PR number or URL is provided (e.g., `123` or `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`), the command fetches the stack on GitHub, pulls the branches, and sets up the stack locally. If the stack already exists locally and matches, it switches to the branch. If the local and remote stacks have different compositions, you'll be prompted to resolve the conflict.

When a branch name is provided, the command resolves it against locally tracked stacks only.

When run without arguments in an interactive terminal, shows a menu of all locally available stacks to choose from.

**Examples:**

```sh
# Check out a stack by PR number
gh stack checkout 42

# Check out a stack by PR URL
gh stack checkout https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42

# Check out a stack by branch name (local only)
gh stack checkout feature-auth

# Interactive — select from locally tracked stacks
gh stack checkout
```

### `gh stack modify`

Interactively restructure the current stack.

```sh
gh stack modify [flags]
```

Opens an interactive terminal UI for restructuring a stack. All changes are staged in the TUI and applied together when you press `Ctrl+S`. Branches from merged PRs cannot be modified.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--continue` | Continue after resolving conflicts |
| `--abort` | Abort the modify session and restore the stack to its pre-modify state |

**Preconditions:**

The command checks these conditions before opening the TUI:

1. Must have an active stack checked out locally
2. Working tree must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
3. No rebase in progress
4. No PR in the stack is queued for merge
5. Commit history must be linear (no merge commits, no diverged branches)

**Operations:**

| Operation | Key | Effect |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Drop | `x` | Remove branch and its commits from stack. Local branch and associated PR are preserved. |
| Fold down | `d` | Absorb commits into branch below (toward trunk). Folded branch removed from stack. |
| Fold up | `u` | Absorb commits into branch above (away from trunk). Folded branch removed from stack. |
| Insert below | `i` | Insert a new empty branch below the cursor (toward trunk). |
| Insert above | `I` | Insert a new empty branch above the cursor (away from trunk). |
| Move down | `Shift+↓` | Reorder branch down (toward trunk) in the stack |
| Move up | `Shift+↑` | Reorder branch up (away from trunk) in the stack |
| Rename | `r` | Rename the branch (opens inline prompt) |
| Undo | `z` | Undo the last staged action |

**Apply phase:**

When you press `Ctrl+S`, the staged changes are applied by renaming branches, inserting new branches, folding/dropping branches, and running a cascading rebase to create a linear commit history with the desired stack state.

If a rebase conflict occurs, you can:
- Resolve conflicts, stage files, and run `gh stack modify --continue`
- Or run `gh stack modify --abort` to abort the operation and restore the stack to the pre-modify state

**After modifying:**

If a stack of PRs has been created on GitHub, run `gh stack submit` to push the updated branches and recreate the stack. The old stack is automatically replaced.

**Examples:**

```sh
# Open the interactive modify TUI
gh stack modify

# Continue after resolving a conflict
gh stack modify --continue

# Abort and restore to the previous state
gh stack modify --abort
```

### `gh stack unstack`

Remove a stack from local tracking and delete it on GitHub. Also available as `gh stack delete`.

```sh
gh stack unstack [flags]
```

You must have a branch from the stack checked out locally. The command targets the active stack — the one that contains the currently checked out branch.

Deletes the stack on GitHub first, if it exists, then removes it from local tracking. If the remote deletion fails, the local state is left untouched so you can retry. Use `--local` to skip the remote deletion and only remove local tracking.

This is useful when you need to restructure a stack — remove a branch, insert a branch, reorder branches, rename branches, or make other large changes. After unstacking, use `gh stack init` to re-create the stack with the desired structure — existing branches are adopted automatically.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--local` | Only delete the stack locally (keep it on GitHub) |

**Examples:**

```sh
# Delete the stack on GitHub and remove local tracking
gh stack unstack

# Only remove local tracking
gh stack unstack --local
```

---

## Remote Operations

### `gh stack submit`

Push all branches and create/update PRs and the stack on GitHub.

```sh
gh stack submit [flags]
```

Creates a Stacked PR for every branch in the stack, pushing branches to the remote. After creating PRs, `submit` automatically creates a **Stack** on GitHub to link the PRs together. If the stack already exists on GitHub (e.g., from a previous submit), new PRs are added to the existing stack.

When creating new PRs, you will be prompted to enter a title for each one. Press Enter to accept the default (branch name), or use `--auto` to skip prompting entirely. New PRs are created as **drafts by default**; use `--open` to create new PRs as ready for review and to mark existing PRs as ready for review.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--auto` | Use auto-generated PR titles without prompting |
| `--open` | Create new PRs as ready for review instead of drafts, and mark existing PRs as ready for review |
| `--remote <name>` | Remote to push to (defaults to auto-detected remote) |

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack submit
gh stack submit --auto
gh stack submit --open
```

### `gh stack sync`

Fetch, rebase, push, and sync PR state in a single command.

```sh
gh stack sync [flags]
```

Performs a safe, non-interactive synchronization of the entire stack:

1. **Fetch** — fetches the latest changes from `origin`.
2. **Fast-forward trunk** — fast-forwards the trunk branch to match the remote (skips if diverged).
3. **Cascade rebase** — rebases all stack branches onto their updated parents (only if trunk moved). If a conflict is detected, all branches are restored to their original state, and you are advised to run `gh stack rebase` to resolve conflicts interactively.
4. **Push** — pushes all branches (uses `--force-with-lease` if a rebase occurred).
5. **Sync PRs** — syncs PR state from GitHub and reports the status of each PR.
6. **Prune** — in interactive terminals, prompts to delete local branches for merged PRs. Use `--prune` to prune automatically.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--remote <name>` | Remote to fetch from and push to (defaults to auto-detected remote) |
| `--prune` | Delete local branches for merged PRs |

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack sync

# Sync and automatically prune merged branches
gh stack sync --prune
```

### `gh stack rebase`

Pull from remote and do a cascading rebase across the stack.

```sh
gh stack rebase [flags] [branch]
```

Fetches the latest changes from `origin`, then ensures each branch in the stack has the tip of the previous layer in its commit history. Rebases branches in order from trunk upward.

If a branch's PR has been merged, the rebase automatically switches to `--onto` mode to correctly replay commits on top of the merge target.

If a rebase conflict occurs, the operation pauses and prints the conflicted files with line numbers. Resolve the conflicts, stage with `git add`, and continue with `--continue`. To undo the entire rebase, use `--abort` to restore all branches to their pre-rebase state.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--downstack` | Only rebase branches from trunk to the current branch |
| `--upstack` | Only rebase branches from the current branch to the top |
| `--no-trunk` | Skip trunk — only rebase stack branches onto each other (no fetch, no trunk rebase) |
| `--continue` | Continue the rebase after resolving conflicts |
| `--abort` | Abort the rebase and restore all branches to their pre-rebase state |
| `--remote <name>` | Remote to fetch from (defaults to auto-detected remote) |
| `--committer-date-is-author-date` | Set the committer date to the author date during rebase. Alias: `--preserve-dates` |

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[branch]` | Target branch (defaults to the current branch) |

**Examples:**

```sh
# Rebase the entire stack
gh stack rebase

# Only rebase branches below the current one
gh stack rebase --downstack

# Only rebase branches above the current one
gh stack rebase --upstack

# Rebase stack branches without pulling from or rebasing with trunk
gh stack rebase --no-trunk

# After resolving a conflict
gh stack rebase --continue

# Abort rebase and restore everything
gh stack rebase --abort

# Rebase and preserve committer date as author date
gh stack rebase --committer-date-is-author-date
```

### `gh stack push`

Push all branches in the current stack to the remote.

```sh
gh stack push [flags]
```

Pushes every branch to the remote using `--force-with-lease --atomic`. This is a lightweight wrapper around `git push` that knows about all branches in the stack. It does not create or update pull requests — use `gh stack submit` for that.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--remote <name>` | Remote to push to (defaults to auto-detected remote) |

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack push
gh stack push --remote upstream
```

### `gh stack link`

Link PRs into a stack on GitHub without local tracking.

```sh
gh stack link [flags] <branch-or-pr> <branch-or-pr> [...]
```

Creates or updates a stack on GitHub from branch names or PR numbers/URLs. This command does not create or modify any `gh-stack` local tracking state. It is designed for users who manage branches with other tools locally (e.g., jj, Sapling, git-town) and want to simply open a stack of PRs.

Arguments are provided in stack order (bottom to top). Branch arguments are automatically pushed to the remote before creating or looking up PRs. For branches that already have open PRs, those PRs are used. For branches without PRs, new PRs are created automatically with the correct base branch chaining. Existing PRs whose base branch doesn't match the expected chain are corrected automatically.

If the PRs are not yet in a stack, a new stack is created. If some of the PRs are already in a stack, the existing stack is updated to include the new PRs. Existing PRs are never removed from a stack — the update is additive only.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--base <branch>` | Base branch for the bottom of the stack (default: `main`) |
| `--open` | Mark new and existing PRs as ready for review |
| `--remote <name>` | Remote to push to (defaults to auto-detected remote) |

**Examples:**

```sh
# Link branches into a stack (pushes, creates PRs, creates stack)
gh stack link feature-auth feature-api feature-ui

# Link existing PRs by number
gh stack link 10 20 30

# Link existing PRs by URL
gh stack link https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/10 https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/20

# Add branches to an existing stack of PRs
gh stack link 42 43 feature-auth feature-ui

# Use a different base branch and mark PRs as ready for review
gh stack link --base develop --open feat-a feat-b feat-c
```

## Navigation

Move between branches in the current stack without having to remember branch names. The **bottom** of the stack is the branch closest to the trunk, and the **top** is furthest from it. `up` moves away from trunk; `down` moves toward it.

All navigation commands clamp to the bounds of the stack — moving up from the top or down from the bottom is a no-op with a message.

### `gh stack switch`

Interactively switch to another branch in the stack.

```sh
gh stack switch
```

Shows an interactive picker listing all branches in the current stack, ordered from top (furthest from trunk) to bottom (closest to trunk) with their position number. Select a branch to check it out.

Requires an interactive terminal.

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack switch
#    → Select a branch in the stack to switch to
#      5. frontend
#      4. api-endpoints
#      3. auth-layer
#      2. db-schema
#      1. config-setup
```

### `gh stack up`

Move up toward the top of the stack (away from trunk).

```sh
gh stack up [n]
```

Moves up `n` branches (default 1). If you're on the trunk branch, `up` moves to the first stack branch.

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack up          # move up one layer
gh stack up 3        # move up three layers
```

### `gh stack down`

Move down toward the bottom of the stack (toward trunk).

```sh
gh stack down [n]
```

Moves down `n` branches (default 1).

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack down        # move down one layer
gh stack down 2      # move down two layers
```

### `gh stack top`

Jump to the top of the stack.

```sh
gh stack top
```

Checks out the branch furthest from the trunk.

### `gh stack bottom`

Jump to the bottom of the stack.

```sh
gh stack bottom
```

Checks out the branch closest to the trunk.

### `gh stack trunk`

Jump to the trunk branch.

```sh
gh stack trunk
```

Checks out the trunk branch of the current stack (e.g., `main`). You must be on a branch that is part of a stack.

---

## Utilities

### `gh stack alias`

Create a short command alias so you can type less.

```sh
gh stack alias [flags] [name]
```

Installs a small wrapper script into `~/.local/bin/` that forwards all arguments to `gh stack`. The default alias name is `gs`, but you can choose any name by passing it as an argument. After setup, you can run `gs push` instead of `gh stack push`.

On Windows, automatic alias creation is not supported — the command prints manual instructions for creating a batch file or PowerShell function.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--remove` | Remove a previously created alias |

**Examples:**

```sh
# Create the default alias (gs)
gh stack alias
#    → now "gs push", "gs view", etc. all work

# Create a custom alias
gh stack alias gst

# Remove an alias
gh stack alias --remove
gh stack alias --remove gst
```

### `gh stack feedback`

Share feedback about gh-stack.

```sh
gh stack feedback [title]
```

Opens a GitHub Discussion in the [gh-stack repository](https://github.com/github/gh-stack) to submit feedback. Optionally provide a title for the discussion post.

**Examples:**

```sh
gh stack feedback
gh stack feedback "Support for reordering branches"
```
